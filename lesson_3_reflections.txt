When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

  When I want to share my repository with others

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    So that only the file that I want to pull is being pulled and perhaps I want to pull at some time after I make several changes, not everytime.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks: cloning repo in github - use when I want to copy someone's repo in github and not changing the original
    Clone: cloning repo anywhere (could be between github, between local and github) - when I want to copy someone's repo to my local/ github and can affect the original 
    Branches: Another place to put any changes without affecting the main place - when I want to make changes without affecting the original, so I create another place to do it

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
